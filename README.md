# keyKiller-Cuda
KeyKiller is designed to achieve extreme performance on modern NVIDIA GPUs, solving the Satoshi puzzle. It leverages CUDA, warp-level parallelism, and batched EC operations to push the boundaries of cryptographic key discovery. It is commonly used in research projects such as Secp256k1-CUDA,Brainflayer,BitCrack, Keyhunt CUDA BitCrack,RCKangaroo.
